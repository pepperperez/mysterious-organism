# mysterious-organism
Solution to Codecademy Mysterious Organism challenge project

## Context: 
Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism that is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates make the organism an interesting specimen to study. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of the organism for your research team to study. 

## The steps:
1. Generate a randon DNA base.
2. Create a single strand of DNA comprised of 15 randomly generated bases.
3. Create organism objects that has:
    - a unique id number;
    - a dna strand;
    - a mutation;
    - a comparison to other organism objects;
    - a calculation of its likelyhood of survival.
 4. Create an array of 30 organism specimens most likely to survive.

 *Note:* My 30-organism array is called jellyArray because Codecademy chose to call the organism pAequor, and Aequoreidae are a family of organisms related to jellyfish.
